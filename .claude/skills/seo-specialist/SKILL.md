This skill guides the creation of search-engine-optimized content that ranks high on Google/Bing while maintaining exceptional readability. Implement proven SEO strategies that satisfy algorithms without sounding robotic.

The user provides an SEO task: a topic to write about, a keyword to target, or existing content to audit. They may include context about the target audience or specific competitors.

## SEO Strategy & Thinking

Before generating content, understand the context and commit to a DATA-DRIVEN direction:

- **Search Intent**: What is the user *actually* looking for? Identify if it is Informational (How-to), Transactional (Buy), Commercial Investigation (Best X vs Y), or Navigational.
- **Audience Persona**: Who is reading? Adjust tone (Technical, Beginner-friendly, Professional, Casual) to match the intent.
- **Keyword Cluster**: Don't just pick one word. Identify the **Primary Keyword** and supporting **LSI/Semantic Keywords** to build topical authority.
- **Differentiation**: Why should Google rank this #1? Is it more comprehensive? Does it offer a unique angle? Better examples?

**CRITICAL**: Balance "Engine-First" (keywords, structure) with "Human-First" (engagement, value). High rankings mean nothing if the user bounces immediately.

Then execute the task (Content Writing, Audit, Strategy) with:

- Strict hierarchical structure (H1, H2, H3)
- Natural keyword integration
- Optimization for Featured Snippets (clear definitions, lists, tables)
- Actionable value

## Optimization Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Structure & Hierarchy**: Use exactly one H1 tag containing the primary keyword. Use H2s for main sections and H3s for subsections. Break text into short, skimmable paragraphs. Use bullet points and bold text to guide the eye.
- **Meta Data**: Craft click-worthy **Title Tags** (under 60 chars) that place the keyword near the front. Write **Meta Descriptions** (under 160 chars) that act as an ad copy with a clear Call-to-Action (CTA).
- **Keyword Placement**: Place the primary keyword in the first 100 words, in the conclusion, and naturally throughout headers. Use LSI keywords to provide context to search engines.
- **URL Slugs**: Suggest short, hyphenated, keyword-rich URLs (e.g., `/seo-guide-for-beginners` instead of `/post-123`).
- **Content Depth**: Cover the topic comprehensively ("Skyscraper Technique"). Answer "People Also Ask" questions related to the topic.
- **Internal/External Linking**: Suggest authoritative external links to cite sources and internal links to keep users on the site.

NEVER use "Black Hat" or outdated tactics like Keyword Stuffing (forcing words where they don't fit), hidden text, or creating Duplicate Content. Avoid "Fluff" (sentences that add zero value).

**IMPORTANT**: Match the content length to the competition. If the top ranking pages are 2,000 words, do not generate a 500-word summary.

Remember: The goal is to be the **best answer on the internet** for the specific query. Write with authority, clarity, and precision.
